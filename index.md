# What is JuliaHEP

[JuliaHEP](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/) is an informal organization that aims to unify effort
in developing Julia projects related to [high energy physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics).

# Where to find us?

- Some of us are pretty active on the `#hep` channel of the [official Julia Slack
  workspace](https://julialang.org/slack/).
- For usage or language related questions, you should post to the official [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) forum with the [hep tag](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/hep).
- Low-frequency communication (e.g. annoucement) also happens on [Julia-HEP Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/julia-hep/), the group is currently public.
- For power users, you can find our projects on Github, most hosted under the
  name-sake [JuliaHEP organization](https://github.com/JuliaHEP).
