# What is JuliaHEP

[JuliaHEP](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/) is an informal organization that aims to unify effort
in developing Julia projects related to [high energy physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics).

# Where to find us?

- Some of us are pretty active on the `#hep` channel of the [official Julia Slack
  workspace](https://julialang.org/slack/).
- For usage or language related questions, you should post to the official [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) forum with the [hep tag](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/hep).
- Low-frequency communication (e.g. annoucement) also happens on [Julia-HEP Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/julia-hep/), the group is currently public.
- For power users, you can find our projects on Github, most hosted under the
  name-sake [JuliaHEP organization](https://github.com/JuliaHEP).

# HSF Working Group
JuliaHEP is also one of the activities of the HEP Software Foundation ([HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org)). It organizes regular [topical meetings](https://indico.cern.ch/category/16956/) and [workshops](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7971/) for improving the sharing of knowledge and expertise, as well as unify effort in developing Julia packages useful for the HEP community. All conveners of the working group can be reached at [hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com).
