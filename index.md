# JuliaHEP

[JuliaHEP](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/) is an informal organization that aims to unify effort
in developing Julia projects related to [high energy physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics).

## JuliaHEP Workshops

We organise annual workshops for the JuliaHEP community. These are a great place to present new projects and updates.

- [JuliaHEP Workshop 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/e/juliahep202/) at CERN
- [JuliaHEP Workshop 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1292759/) at ECAP (Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics)

## JuliaHEP Topical Meetings

We organise topical meetings on subjects of interest to the JuliaHEP community -
this can be a presentation on a new package, an update, or discussion of an
interesting problem.

- [JuliaHEP Topical Meeting Calendar](https://indico.cern.ch/category/16956/)

You are very welcome to propose a topic, just contact the [JuliaHEP
conveners](mailto:hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com).

## Where to find us?

- Many of us are pretty active on the `#hep` channel of the [official Julia Slack
  workspace](https://julialang.org/slack/).
- For usage or language related questions, you should post to the official [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) forum with the [hep tag](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/hep).
- Low-frequency communication (e.g. annoucement) also happens on [Julia-HEP Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/julia-hep/), the group is currently public.
- You can find our projects on Github, most hosted under the
  name-sake [JuliaHEP organization](https://github.com/JuliaHEP).

### HSF Working Group

JuliaHEP is also one of the activities of the HEP Software Foundation ([HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/juliahep.html)). All conveners of the working group can be reached at [hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com).
